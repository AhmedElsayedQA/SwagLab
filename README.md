# SwagLab Checkout Flow

This project demonstrates test automation using Selenium, Maven, and TestNG with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It includes automated tests for the checkout flow on the Swag Labs website.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed -V 11
- Maven installed
- WebDriver compatible with your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open your IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse) and import the cloned project into your workspace.

3. Once the project is imported, navigate to the CheckoutFlowTest class located in the src/test/java directory.

4. Open the CheckoutFlowTest class and ensure that the necessary WebDriver initialization code is present. If not, you may need to add it.

5. Configure the WebDriver to use the browser of your choice

6. Once the WebDriver is properly configured, you can run the test suite by right-clicking on the CheckoutFlowTest class and selecting "Run" or "Run As" (depending on your IDE).

7. The test suite will start executing, and you will see the test progress and results in the IDE's console or test runner window.
